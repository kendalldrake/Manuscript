            On the day after the Senior critiques finished up last month, a student hobbled into my office for her post mortem, wearing sweats and a tendonitis boot. This student, along with making work for her first Senior Degree Project critique, had overworked her body, preparing to dance the Snow Queen in a local company’s annual Nutcracker ballet. And so, the boot. Some dancers are not highly intellectual, being creatures of movement, but the Snow Queen is not that kind of dancer. She is bright, verbal and as interested in philosophy as she is in design. Planning to end her career as a performer at the end of this season—20 is getting up there for a dancer-- she had over-trained in a quest for perfection, and her ligaments hurt.  When she came to my office, she was tired, battling pain, and, in her polite way, angry.

            That first Senior Degree Project critique is never easy. The groups of critics don’t know each other. The time allotted is always too short. The critics are a good mix for one student and nonsensical for another. The student must explain the beginning stages of a year-long project to strangers who know only what she has written about her goals for the project. The critics feel as though they must give the school its money’s worth, and so tend to <em>“throw fish”</em>-- give top-of-the-head solutions—or point out seeming deficiencies in form, form that the student has not yet begun to think through. When I was a critic, I did all these things. It is ever thus, and has been at every institution at which I have ever taught. We work to make critique better each time, but each time responds to different curricular changes, different departmental emphases, different provostial dicta. And so the days after that first Senior crit are hard, because the students have been knocked around, even at the most student-centered, kindly institution. The rubber has met the road. Rough hands have searched the pudding for its proof.

            But back to the Snow Queen. She clomped in and sat down gingerly. We talked about the crit. It had been wide of the mark. It hadn’t helped her. And then she said something that echoed comments I had been getting from other students, but had not yet really heard. She said, “Why isn’t beauty enough? Why can’t I just make beautiful things? Why is everything I make not “edgy” enough, not “socially aware” enough, not “corporate” enough?” A saturated solution, liquid in the test tube, will crystallize suddenly if you give the side of the tube a good flick with your fingernail. The Snow Queen’s comment jarred me: and saturated thoughts crystalized.

            Clatter of the Snow Queen is a blog about the difficulties that are synonymous with being an artist or designer in contemporary culture, due to the social constructs of perfection. The narrative goes on to explain how postmodern society has engrained within us an expectation that anything we do or create as an artist is just not good enough. We get broken down, piece by piece through harsh critique, most of which is validated by a set of rules, delivered by a panel of individuals who are governed by an inflexible culture. This culture is the reason why we often push ourselves to the brink of collapse, in an effort to achieve the impossible.

            Ilyin’s moment of clarity came about when a student of hers, a ballerina, hobbled into her office for what the blogger referred to as a <em>“post mortem”</em>, a meeting held the day after the student’s first senior, degree project critique. This particular student had worked herself to the bone to prepare for a role as the Snow Queen in the annual Nutcracker ballet. It was not the first time a student had walked into Ilyin’s office angry, however, this time it really hit home when she blurted out “Why isn’t beauty enough? Why can’t I just make beautiful things? Why is everything I make not “edgy” enough, not “socially aware” enough, not “corporate” enough?”
            In closing, Ilyin’s perspective is that the time of harsh critique is outdated, instead we should be encouraging “enclosure, resolution and unity” without the influence and constraints of a society that favours a modernist agenda.
